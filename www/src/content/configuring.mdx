# Configuring

Many of the core features of this template need configuration before you can use them.

## Environment Variables

This template relies on environment variables to work. You can use the `.env.example` file as a starting guide; rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.

## Enabling Magic Links

Magic links are a great way to sign in users without them needing to have any social media accounts. Magic links are not enabled by default, due to requiring an email provider and live domain and DNS record setup. To enable magic links, follow these steps:

1. Follow the [Auth.js documentation](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/resend#configuration) up to and including setting the `AUTH_RESEND_KEY` environment variable.
2. Be sure to set `MAGIC_LINK_EMAIL_FROM` to the email address you want to send magic links from.

That's it! Note domain validation with Resend will be required for magic links to work, and could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to validate.
