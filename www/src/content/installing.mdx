# Installing

Use the handy CLI tool to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with auth already set up.

```bash
pnpm dlx next-auth-template
# or
npx next-auth-template
# or
bunx --bun next-auth-template
```

You will be asked to select a template:

```bash
? Select a template › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   One-to-one
    One-to-many
```

You will also be asked to provide a project name. This is also used as the directory name. You can leave it as default (.) to have the project initialized into the current directory. Must be a single word, no special characters.

```bash
? Enter the name of your project › .
```

If everything goes well, you will see a message of confirmation.

```bash
✔ Template copied successfully to /path/to/project
```

## Non-interactive

You can also use the CLI non-interactively; provide arguments and options to the CLI to skip the prompts.

```bash
