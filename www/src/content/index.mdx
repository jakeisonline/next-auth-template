- Database-backed sessions all managed for you thanks to [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) and [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- Basic account creation and set up for first time users
- Google Sign-in ready for config, easily add [other providers Auth.js has to offer](https://authjs.dev/reference/core/providers)
- Optional [Magic Links](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/email) via [Resend](https://resend.com/emails) ready for config, or [any other email provider Auth.js can support](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/email#providers)
- Protected paths via middleware, easily customisable to your needs
