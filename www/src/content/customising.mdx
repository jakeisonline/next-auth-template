# Customising

While this template is designed to be as simple as possible, with the intention of you enhancing it further, there are a few changes you might want to make.

### Change PostgreSQL host

This template expects a PostgreSQL database, and uses Drizzle ORM to interface with it. Out of the box, Drizzle is configured to use Neon, but you can change this to any other PostgreSQL host.

1. In `db/db.ts`, change the `sql` variable to point to your PostgreSQL host of choice, so long as Drizzle has an adapter for it.

See [Drizzle ORM's documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql) for more information.

### Add other Auth.js providers

This template uses Google Sign-in, but you can add other providers Auth.js supports.

1. Browse the available providers in [Auth.js's documentation](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/oauth)
2. Add the required environment variables for your new provider to `.env`
3. In `src/lib/auth.ts`, add the provider to the `providers` array (and be sure to import it!)
4. On your sign in and sign up pages, add `<SocialSignInButton provider="new_provider" />` component where `new_provider` is the name of the provider you added

### Change Email Provider

By default, this template uses [Resend](https://resend.com/emails) to send magic links. You can change this to any other email provider that Auth.js supports.

See [Auth.js's documentation](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/email#signin-5) for more information on which email providers Auth.js supports. You'll need to update `lib/auth.ts` and `actions/magic-auth.ts` to support the new provider.
