Sign up and auth, super quick with database-backed sessions, social sign in, magic links, and multiple user models to choose from. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with auth already set up for you so you can focus on the fun stuff.

## Usage

This CLI offers two ways to initialize a new project with auth already set up.

### Interactive

```bash
pnpm dlx next-auth-template
# or
npx next-auth-template
# or
bunx --bun next-auth-template
```

You will be asked to select a template:

```bash
? Select a template › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   One-to-one
    One-to-many
```

You will also be asked to provide a project name:

```bash
? Enter the name of your project › .
```

This is also used as the directory name. You can leave it as default (`.`) to have the project initialized into the current directory. Must be a single word, no special characters.

```bash
✔ Template copied successfully to /path/to/project
```

If everything goes well, you will see a message of confirmation.

### Non-interactive

See `next-auth-template --help` for more information.

```bash
