This template gets you up a running with social sign in, magic links, database-backed sessions, and account creation and setup. It's a good starting point for your next project.

## Features

- Custom sign in and sign up pages as a starting point for your own
- Database-backed sessions all managed for you thanks to [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) and [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- Basic account creation and set up for first time users
- Google Sign-in ready for config, easily add [other providers Auth.js has to offer](https://authjs.dev/reference/core/providers)
- Optional [Magic Links](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/email) via [Resend](https://resend.com/emails) ready for config, or [any other email provider Auth.js can support](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/email#providers)
- Protected paths via middleware, easily customisable to your needs

> [!NOTE]
> This template uses major dependencies that are not yet stable. It is not recommended for production use until `next-auth` and `drizzle-orm` are stable

# Getting Started

There is some initial setup required to get this template up and running. It won't take long.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
- A PostgreSQL database. This template uses [Neon](https://neon.tech/), but there are other options.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo, or [use it as a GitHub template](https://github.com/jakeisonline/next-auth-template/generate) (using Vercel? [Deploy template](<https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjakeisonline%2Fnext-auth-template&env=DATABASE_URL,NEXTAUTH_URL,AUTH_SECRET,AUTH_GOOGLE_ID,AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET,AUTH_RESEND_KEY,AUTH_MAGIC_LINK_EMAIL_FROM&envDescription=API%20keys%20needed%20for%20signing%20in%20with%20Google%20and%20emailing%20magic%20links&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjakeisonline%2Fnext-auth-template%3Ftab%3Dreadme-ov-file%23envrionment-variables&redirect-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjakeisonline%2Fnext-auth-template%3Ftab%3Dreadme-ov-file%23next-auth-template&demo-title=See%20next-auth-template%20in%20action&demo-description=An%20(almost)%20vanilla%20deploy%20of%20this%20template.%20Resets%20any%20users%20and%20sessions%20every%20few%20hours.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fnext-auth-template-demo.vercel.app%2F&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fcamo.githubusercontent.com%2Fc69f49b98c29ba792daf811661b5448ec743f721047119358ac2603ca0531b73%2F68747470733a2f2f6a616b6569736f6e6c696e652e636f6d2f6f70656e67726170682d696d6167652e706e67>))
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below)
3. Run `pnpm install && pnpm run db:push` to install dependencies and push the database schema
4. Run `pnpm run dev` to start the development server
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`, and click the "Sign up" or "Sign in" buttons

### Enabling Magic Links

Magic links are a great way to sign in users without having to create an account, but are not enabled by default due to requiring an email provider and live domain and DNS record setup. To enable them, follow these steps:

1. Follow the [Auth.js documentation](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/resend#configuration) up to and including setting the `AUTH_RESEND_KEY` environment variable.
2. Be sure to set `MAGIC_LINK_EMAIL_FROM` to the email address you want to send magic links from.

That's it! Note domain validation with Resend will be required for magic links to work, and could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to validate.

# Customising

This template is designed to be as simple as possible, and it's intended that you customise it to your needs, using your own coding skills. Nonetheless, there are some things you can customise to make it easier to get started.

## Change PostgreSQL host

This template expects a PostgreSQL database, and uses Drizzle ORM to interface with it. Out of the box, Drizzle is configured to use Neon, but you can change this to any other PostgreSQL host.

1. In [`db/db.ts`](src/db/db.ts), change the `sql` variable to point to your PostgreSQL provider of choice.

See [Drizzle ORM's documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql) for more information.

## Add other Auth.js providers

This template uses Google Sign-in, but you can add other providers Auth.js supports.

1. Browse the available providers in [Auth.js's documentation](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/oauth)
2. Add the required environment variables for your new provider to `.env`
3. In [`src/lib/auth.ts`](src/lib/auth.ts), add the provider to the `providers` array (and be sure to import it!)
4. On your sign in and sign up pages, add `<SocialSignInButton provider="new_provider" />` component where `new_provider` is the name of the provider you added

## Change Email Provider

By default, this template uses [Resend](https://resend.com/emails) to send magic links. You can change this to any other email provider that Auth.js supports.

See [Auth.js's documentation](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/email#signin-5) for more information on which email providers Auth.js supports. You'll need to update [`lib/auth.ts`](src/lib/auth.ts) and [`actions/magic-auth.ts`](src/actions/magic-auth.ts) to support the new provider.

# Environment Variables

This template relies on environment variables to work. You can use the [`.env.example`](.env.example) file as a starting guide; rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.
